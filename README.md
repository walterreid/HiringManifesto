# The Candidate-Centric Hiring Manifesto

> "If your hiring process doesn‚Äôt reflect your culture, it‚Äôs not a process problem. It‚Äôs a values problem."  
>

> "Company culture doesn‚Äôt begin after someone signs the offer. It starts the moment they open the job application."

## Why This Manifesto Exists

We‚Äôve written manifestos for how we build. How we ship. How we scale. But not how we hire.

Hiring is not separate from culture‚Äîit is your culture, exported through email, calendars, and silence. This manifesto is a call to treat it as such.

## Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways to attract and integrate talent by doing it‚Äîand by helping others do it. Through this work, we‚Äôve come to value:

- **[Human connection and empathy](principles/01-human-connection.md)** over automated processes and impersonal tools  
- **[Candidate experience and dignity](principles/02-candidate-dignity.md)** over recruiter convenience and expediency  
- **[Transparent and timely communication](principles/03-communication.md)** over ambiguity and silence  
- **[Constructive feedback and growth](principles/04-feedback.md)** over ghosting and lack of closure  
- **[Equitable opportunity and trust](principles/05-equity.md)** over inherent bias and rigid filters  
- **[The foundational relationship](principles/06-relationship-over-transaction.md)** over the transactional hire  
 
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

If you believe in clarity, show it in your timelines.  
If you believe in empathy, show it in your rejections.  
If you believe people matter, don‚Äôt make them guess.

This manifesto isn‚Äôt finished. But neither is your hiring process. Let‚Äôs make both better ‚Äî together.

## üôå Rallying Cry
**Hiring With Humanity.**

Your hiring process is the first product a candidate experiences.  
If that product is buggy, opaque, or dehumanizing‚Äîyour culture probably is too.

Let this be our shared commitment:  
From the first open tab to the kindest rejection letter they‚Äôll ever receive.

This manifesto is open for contribution, iteration, and adoption.  
Let‚Äôs build better hiring‚Äîtogether.
