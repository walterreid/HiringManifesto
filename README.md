# The Candidate-Centric Hiring Manifesto

> "If your hiring process doesn’t reflect your culture, it’s not a process problem. It’s a values problem."  
> — Walter Reid

> "Company culture doesn’t begin after someone signs the offer. It starts the moment they open the job application."

## Why This Manifesto Exists

We’ve written manifestos for how we build. How we ship. How we scale. But not how we hire.

Hiring is not separate from culture—it is your culture, exported through email, calendars, and silence. This manifesto is a call to treat it as such.

## Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways to attract and integrate talent by doing it—and by helping others do it. Through this work, we’ve come to value:

- **Human connection and empathy** over automated processes and impersonal tools  
- **Candidate experience and dignity** over recruiter convenience and expediency  
- **Transparent and timely communication** over ambiguity and silence  
- **Constructive feedback and growth** over ghosting and lack of closure  
- **Equitable opportunity and trust** over inherent bias and rigid filters  
- **The foundational relationship** over the transactional hire  

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

If you believe in clarity, show it in your timelines.  
If you believe in empathy, show it in your rejections.  
If you believe people matter, don’t make them guess.

This manifesto isn’t finished. But neither is your hiring process. Let’s make both better — together.
